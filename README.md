Pointblank: Jelly is a continuation of the Vic's Point Blank mod by Vic4Games given his 6-month silence. Since VPB is ARR if the original author requests, Pointblank: Jelly will be removed.

## Project Goals
1) Expand upon Pointblank's content pack features.
2) Enhance compatibility with various other mods, namely VS2 and FirstAid style mods.
3) Ensure compatibility with future versions of mods.

 
## Player Information
This mod will be compatible with any 1.9.6 Pointblank packs.
 
## Developer Information
If you wish to contribute it is extremely appreciated! Just clone the repository, make changes and create a Pull Request.

## Roadmap
- Conversion from Hitscan based firing to Projectile based firing for better compatibility,
  weapons with an optional hitscan boolean in the data json will still use the old hitscan system, mostly for melee weapons
- Transfer of all default pointblank weapons to their own content pack to allow for easier modification of the base weapons
  and to serve as an example for future developers.
- New types of items for content pack developers to create, primarily content pack-able armor systems.
- Scripting system using the Groovy language for more control with content packs
