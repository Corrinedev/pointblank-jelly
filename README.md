## Project Goals
1) Expand upon Pointblank's content pack features.
2) Enhance compatibility with various other mods, namely VS2 and FirstAid style mods.
3) Ensure compatibility with future versions of mods.

## Roadmap
- Conversion from Hitscan based firing to Projectile based firing for better compatibility, (DONE!)
  weapons with an optional hitscan boolean in the data json will still use the old hitscan system, mostly for melee weapons
- Transfer of all default pointblank weapons to their own content pack to allow for easier modification of the base weapons (DONE!)
  and to serve as an example for future developers.
- New types of items for content pack developers to create, primarily content pack-able armor systems. (DONE! Armors added)
- Scripting system using the JavaScript language for more control with content packs (Mostly Done...)
